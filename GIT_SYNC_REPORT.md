## Repository Information from GitHub

According to the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/vanya-vasya/rankingbrokers/):

- **Default Branch:** `main`
- **Total Branches:** 86 branches
- **Stars:** 0
- **Forks:** 0
- **Last Commit (main):** eaf7d19 - "Add remaining files: setup scripts and backup files"
- **README Status:** Shows "yum-mi" as title (outdated, needs update on main branch)

## Key Findings

### 1. Content Mismatch Issue
The audit revealed a **critical content mismatch**:
- **Header Navigation:** Shows broker-related links (Brokers Review, Best Brokers, Blog, About)
- **Page Content:** Still describes food/nutrition app (MINDFUL EATER, calories, recipes)

**Status:** This is NOT a CSS/layout regression. The layout and styling are working correctly. This is a content strategy issue.

### 2. Branch Strategy
You are working on `cleanup/landing-only` which is **ahead** of `main`. This branch:
- ✅ Removed all database code
- ✅ Removed authentication (Clerk)
- ✅ Removed dashboard features
- ✅ Removed payment integrations
- ✅ Simplified to landing page only

### 3. Dependencies Status
All dependencies are installed and current. However:
- ⚠️ Security vulnerabilities exist (non-critical)
- ✅ No missing modules
- ✅ No broken imports

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Address Content Mismatch:**
   - Option A: Update page content to match broker theme
   - Option B: Revert header to food app theme
   - Option C: Create hybrid approach

2. **Security:**
   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Merge Strategy:**
   - Consider merging `cleanup/landing-only` to `main` when ready
   - Or continue development on this branch

### Future Actions
1. **Update GitHub README:**
   - Current README on `main` still shows "yum-mi"
   - Push updated README from cleanup branch

2. **Create Missing Pages:**
   - `/brokers/forex`, `/brokers/crypto`, `/brokers/stocks`, `/brokers/cfd`
   - `/best-brokers`
   - `/blog`
   - `/about`
   - `/contact`

3. **Asset Management:**
   - Verify `/logos/ranking-brokers-logo.png` displays correctly
   - Replace food-related images with broker/financial images

## Test Results
