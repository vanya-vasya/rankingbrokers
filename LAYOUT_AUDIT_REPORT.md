# Layout Audit & Regression Analysis Report
**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Project:** Ranking Brokers Landing Page  
**Status:** Critical Content Mismatch Identified

## Executive Summary

A critical content mismatch has been identified between the site header and the landing page content. The header presents broker-related navigation while the page content describes a food/nutrition tracking application.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **CRITICAL: Content Mismatch**
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** Entire landing page

**Problem:**
- Header Navigation: "Brokers Review", "Best Brokers", "Blog", "About"
- Hero Content: "MINDFUL EATER" - AI Engine for calorie counting and recipes
- Products Section: Master Chef, Master Nutritionist, Cal Tracker, Digest

**Impact:**
- Confusing user experience
- Poor SEO (mismatched keywords)
- Unprofessional brand presentation
- High bounce rate risk

### 2. Header Implementation
**Status:** ✅ Working correctly
**Details:**
- Responsive navigation implemented correctly
- Dropdown for "Brokers Review" functional
- Search icon and "Contact Us" button present
- Mobile hamburger menu works

### 3. Hero Section
**Status:** ⚠️ Content mismatch
**Current Content:**
- Title: "AI Engine built for MINDFUL EATER"
- Description: Food tracking and recipe generation
- CTA: "Begin" button linking to `/dashboard`

**Should be (for brokers site):**
- Title: Broker comparison/review focus
- Description: Financial services and broker insights
- CTA: Relevant to broker selection

### 4. Products Section
**Status:** ⚠️ Wrong products displayed
**Current:** Food-related products (Master Chef, etc.)
**Should be:** Broker categories or review features

### 5. Footer
**Status:** ⚠️ Needs content audit
**Mixed signals:** 
- Company name: "GUARANTEED GREAT SERVICE LTD" (✓)
- Email: `support@rankingbrokers.com` (✓)
- Content description still mentions "AI sidekick counts the calories" (✗)

## Root Causes

1. **Incomplete Migration:** The site was renamed from "Yum-mi" (food app) to "Ranking Brokers" but only the header navigation was updated to reflect the new broker focus.

2. **Partial Updates:** Recent changes updated:
   - ✅ Header navigation structure
   - ✅ Site metadata (title, description in layout.tsx)
   - ✅ Contact email and branding
   - ✗ Landing page content
   - ✗ Hero section messaging
   - ✗ Products/services showcase
